// #153 (P0) — the catalog/selection/embedded-file types round-trip through the same STJ kind-schema as a
// hand-authored .fdgarmy, and — the load-bearing claim of the whole feature — the engine reads a builder-saved
// file as a plain ArmyListFile, silently ignoring the embedded book + selections (so embedding needs no
// engine change).
